                    In an age of bloated frameworks and endless dependencies, there's profound beauty 
                    in crafting experiences that respect both bandwidth and attention.

                <p>
                    We've lost our way in the digital wilderness. What began as a revolution in human 
                    communication has become a monument to excess. The average webpage today weighs 
                    more than the entire game of Doom—a masterpiece of engineering that fit on a 
                    3.5" floppy disk and entertained millions.

                <p>
                    This principle, once applied to aircraft design, holds profound truth for digital 
                    craftsmen. Every line of code, every pixel, every network request should earn its 
                    place through purpose, not presumption.

                    What happens when your entire website fits in a single network request? 
                    A meditation on speed, simplicity, and the essence of digital communication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's something almost mystical about the moment when your creation becomes 
                    small enough to travel as a single TCP packet. Like a haiku capturing the 
                    essence of spring in seventeen syllables, a sub-14KB website distills an 
                    entire digital presence into its purest form.

                    Consider the journey: your thoughts, transformed into HTML, compressed into bytes, 
                    wrapped in headers, and shot through fiber optic cables at the speed of light. 
                    In milliseconds, your digital soul reaches another human consciousness across 
                    continents and time zones.

                    Why the terminal remains the purest interface for thought. On command lines, 
                    consciousness, and the poetry of plain text.

                <p>
                    In the beginning was the command line. Before windows, before icons, before 
                    the tyranny of the mouse, there was the cursor—blinking patiently, waiting 
                    for human intention to take form in precise, unambiguous commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The terminal strips away pretense. No gradients, no animations, no visual 
                    flourishes to distract from the essential dialogue between human and machine. 
                    Each character carries equal weight, each space deliberate, each line a 
                    complete thought expressed in the most direct medium possible.

                    Jazz musicians understand something that web developers have forgotten: 
                    the power of constraint to unleash creativity. Give Miles Davis infinite 
                    possibilities, and he might spend forever searching. Give him four chords 
                    and a deadline, and he'll create Kind of Blue.

                    The 14KB challenge isn't arbitrary masochism—it's a forcing function for 
                    excellence. When every byte matters, when every choice must be justified, 
                    when bloat becomes impossible, magic happens.

                    Excavating the forgotten wisdom of early web design, and what modern 
                    developers can learn from HTML 3.2.

                <p>
                    Sometimes progress is circular. In our rush toward the future, we've abandoned 
                    techniques that solved problems we didn't know we'd have again. The early web, 
                    constrained by 56k modems and primitive browsers, developed an aesthetic of 
                    restraint that seems almost revolutionary today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These forgotten craftsmen understood that every element must justify its 
                    existence. Tables weren't for layout—they were for tabular data. Images 
                    weren't decoration—they were content. Every tag, every attribute, every 
                    decision carried weight because bandwidth was precious and attention was finite.
