            In an age of bloated frameworks and endless dependencies, there's profound beauty 
            in crafting experiences that respect both bandwidth and attention.
        </div>
    </header>

    <main class="content">
        <p>
            We've lost our way in the digital wilderness. What began as a revolution in human 
            communication has become a monument to excess. The average webpage today weighs 
            more than the entire game of Doom—a masterpiece of engineering that fit on a 
            3.5" floppy disk and entertained millions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider this: in 1993, DOOM delivered immersive 3D graphics, networked multiplayer, 
            and hours of gameplay in 2.39 megabytes. Today, many websites require more bandwidth 
            to display a single article than it took to transport players to the moons of Mars 
            and back. Something has gone profoundly wrong with our sense of proportion.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there 
            is nothing left to take away."<br>
            — Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            This principle, once applied to aircraft design, holds profound truth for digital 
            craftsmen. Every line of code, every pixel, every network request should earn its 
            place through purpose, not presumption. Yet we've built an industry that celebrates 
            addition over subtraction, complexity over clarity.
        </p>

        <h2>The Weight of Modern Web</h2>

        <p>
            Open your browser's network tab and witness the carnage. A typical news article 
            loads dozens of JavaScript libraries, tracking scripts, advertisement networks, 
            social media widgets, and analytics packages. The actual content—the words you 
            came to read—often represents less than 5% of the total data transferred.
        </p>

        <p>
            We've normalized this digital obesity. "Internet is fast now," we tell ourselves, 
            forgetting that much of the world still relies on slower connections. We've 
            forgotten that speed isn't just about bandwidth—it's about respect for human 
            attention, environmental responsibility, and the fundamental craft of making 
            things well.
        </p>

        <div class="pullquote">
            The heaviest websites are not the most functional—they are the most frightened.
        </div>

        <h2>The Fear Behind the Bloat</h2>

        <p>
            Why do we build such heavy experiences? The answer lies not in technical necessity 
            but in professional anxiety. We fear that our sites won't look "modern" without 
            the latest framework. We worry that stakeholders won't believe we're serious 
            without complex build processes. We add features not because users need them, 
            but because we're afraid to seem insufficient.
        </p>

        <p>
            This fear manifests in familiar patterns: the designer who adds subtle animations 
            requiring 200KB of JavaScript libraries, the developer who imports an entire 
            icon library for three icons, the marketer who demands seventeen different 
            tracking scripts to measure what could be inferred from server logs.
        </p>

        <h3>The Paradox of Choice</h3>

        <p>
            Modern development offers infinite possibilities, and infinite possibilities 
            create paralysis. When you can use any framework, install any package, 
            implement any pattern, decisions become harder, not easier. The abundance 
            of options doesn't liberate us—it buries us under the weight of choice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Constraint, paradoxically, creates freedom. When you can only use 14KB total, 
            many decisions make themselves. You can't afford framework overhead, so you 
            write vanilla JavaScript. You can't load custom fonts, so you make peace 
            with system typography. You can't include a massive icon library, so you 
            discover the beauty of Unicode symbols and simple shapes.
        </p>

        <h2>Rediscovering Digital Craft</h2>

        <p>
            There's profound satisfaction in hand-crafting HTML and CSS, in understanding 
            exactly what every character in your codebase does. It's the difference between 
            cooking a meal from scratch and assembling ingredients from pre-made packages. 
            Both approaches produce food, but only one teaches you to cook.
        </p>

        <p>
            The constraints of small-size development force you to understand the medium. 
            You learn which CSS properties are expensive, which JavaScript patterns are 
            efficient, which design decisions serve users versus designers. You develop 
            an intimate relationship with your craft that's impossible when abstracted 
            behind layers of tooling and frameworks.
        </p>

        <h3>The Aesthetics of Less</h3>

        <p>
            Minimalism isn't about deprivation—it's about clarity. When you remove the 
            unnecessary, the necessary becomes luminous. A website that does one thing 
            perfectly is more memorable than one that does ten things adequately.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consider the most enduring designs: the Swiss International Style, the 
            typography of Paul Renner, the architecture of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. 
            These works didn't achieve timelessness through addition but through 
            relentless subtraction. They found the essential and eliminated everything else.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. 
            It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage—to move in the opposite direction."<br>
            — E.F. Schumacher
        </blockquote>

        <h2>The Path Forward</h2>

        <p>
            Digital restraint isn't about returning to the past—it's about carrying forward 
            its wisdom. We can use modern CSS features like Grid and Flexbox while avoiding 
            framework bloat. We can implement progressive enhancement while keeping base 
            experiences lightweight. We can create beautiful, functional websites that 
            respect both users and the planet.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 14KB challenge isn't arbitrary asceticism. It's a forcing function for 
            excellence, a way to rediscover what matters when everything else is stripped 
            away. In embracing these constraints, we don't limit our creativity—we focus it.
        </p>

        <div class="pullquote">
            The most radical act in modern web development is to ship less.
        </div>

        <h2>Starting Your Practice</h2>

        <p>
            Begin small. Build a single page without frameworks, without build tools, 
            without dependencies. Write HTML in a text editor. Style it with pure CSS. 
            Deploy it as static files. Feel the direct connection between your intentions 
            and their manifestation in the browser.
        </p>

        <p>
            You might discover, as I did, that this approach isn't limiting—it's liberating. 
            Free from the weight of endless possibilities, you can focus on the essential: 
            creating experiences that serve humans rather than serving the ego of their creators.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a world drunk on complexity, simplicity becomes revolutionary. In an industry 
            addicted to more, less becomes the ultimate luxury. The lost art of digital 
            restraint isn't just about building better websites—it's about becoming better 
            craftspeople.
        </p>

        <p>
            The path is simple, if not easy: subtract until only the essential remains, 
            then subtract some more.
        </p>
